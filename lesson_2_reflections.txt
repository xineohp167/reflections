What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
We initialize a repository but still no commit is made.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is something like a medium area which connects working directory and the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add the changed files to staging area and then commit.
