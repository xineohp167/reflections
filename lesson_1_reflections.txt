It makes much easier and faster to find the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
The easy access to the entire history of a file makes much easier comparing differnt versions ot the source code.
This way we can see the evolution of the code and to see where the bug was first appeared.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
The pros are that you can choose when to save it and why.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, 
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because Git is more focused on software development.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Using git log we can view the comments for the changes and using git diff we can view the changes in
source code.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because you can always return to a previous version of your files using Git where it works correctly.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to try it for software development.
