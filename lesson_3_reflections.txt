When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When i want to make my work public and when i want to work with other people.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 Because this way you can be sure that code with errors is not updated.
