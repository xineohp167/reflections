When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When i want to make my work public and when i want to work with other people.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 Because this way you can be sure that code with errors is not updated.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  
    Using branches the changes are added to the same repisotory.  While forking and cloning both copy an entire repository to
    a new location.  The difference between forking and cloning is that forking
    is a special construct made by GitHub.  You can only fork a GitHub
    repository to another location on GitHub, while you can clone any Git
    repository to anywhere you have access to.

    I use branching for most cases where I want to add new changes to a
    repository while keeping an easy reference to a previous version, especially
    when collaborating with other people.  I clone a repository on GitHub when I
    want to work on that repository locally rather than using the GitHub
    website.  I fork a repository on GitHub when I want to make changes to that
    repository public, but I don't have permission to modify the original.
